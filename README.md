Description: A front end quiz application written as an exercise in learning Vue.
Notes:
1.  While this project is intended to function as if it had a functioning backend, I have no plans to write one! This project is a an exercise in the frontend only. Therefore, all server communication and behaviour is mocked in service classes which could easily be swapped out for the real thing.
2.  Minimal error handling is implemented in the app. This was an intenional decision, since this is an exercise in the fundamentals of Vue and the mock services will never trigger errors.
